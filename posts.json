    "body": "I am a wedding, civil partnership and portrait photography with many years experience in the industry. I work with my clients to ensure that their experience of being photographed is right for them. I ensure that studio sessions are laid back and informal because the best photographs of you will be when you’re looking relaxed, not when you’re sitting at a silly angle with a posed smile on your face (we all remember those old school photos!).",
